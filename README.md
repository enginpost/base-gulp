# base-gulp
My base gulp project template helps me quickly start a new gulp-related test project to sample or demo an idea quickly.

##Steps to getting started:

A. Be sure you have node package manager installed (NPM)
B. Become familiar with NPM and Gulp

...then...

1. Download the project by cloning it into a new local project folder
2. Open package.json
3. Edit the contents to make it yours
4. From the projec root folder, open a terminal window and run "npm install" to download the node modules
5. Run gulp by then typing "gulp" into the terminal window and hit enter
6. Your default browser should load and you should see the initial index.html file from the site folder

Any change you make will reload in real time due to node, gulp and browser-sync.

Notice in the terminal window that you have a network address for the gulp browser-sync address. This should mean that you can load your locally running site in a browser on another local networked computer (like a cellphone on your wifi network).
